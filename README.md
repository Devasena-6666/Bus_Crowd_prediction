## 📌 Overview

The **Smart Bus Tracking & Crowd Prediction System** is an AI-driven urban mobility platform that enables passengers to make smarter travel decisions.

By combining **live GPS bus tracking** with **real-time computer vision–based crowd analysis**, the system reduces uncertainty about bus occupancy — helping to minimize waiting time and improve overall public transport efficiency.

> 💡 Built as part of an academic initiative exploring AI applications in smart city infrastructure.
